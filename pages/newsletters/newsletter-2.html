   <p class="projecttext">I spent a week in Toronto with Dave, Liz and Josh, our old family friends from California. Josh and I spent some time exploring downtown Toronto, 
    biking around the neighborhood and hanging out. Dave, Josh and I went on a 3 day car camping trip to Tobermory a few hours Northwest of Toronto.

   <p class="projecttext">We stopped along the way to see Wiarton Willie, Canada's famous groundhog and a competitor to Punxsutawney Phil. Truly a life changing experience. </p>

   <p class="projecttext">Tobermory was pretty cool, the water was super clear which was surprising for a great lake. We had some lovely wildlife encounters with very domesticated 
    Canadian wildlife. There was a chipmunk that ran up to our hands and touched us looking for food. A raccoon stole our marshmallows the first night, we ended up chasing it around the 
forest for 20 minutes before it ran up a tree and finished our bag of marshmallows.</p>

    <p class="projecttitle">Toronto, ON to Wolfe Island, ON</p>   
    <p class="projecttext">I left Toronto after just over a week and headed to volunteer on a small farm. Prior to leaving I switched the transmission fluid for the factory 
        spec type F fluid. The trip from Toronto to Wolfe Island was 180 miles, I left at 8:30 AM and arrived on Wolfe Island around 6:30 PM. The trip was not too eventful, I made it 
        out of Toronto pretty quickly and didn't get caught in bad traffic (like my trip into Toronto). Small towns, farmland and flat roads made up the rest of the trip. I've 
        been on Wolfe Island for just over a week and will be heading out this Thursday. My next stop is New Hampshire, I'll be camping a night in the Adirondacks in between.
