            I designed and implemented a testing procedure to measure torsional 
            stiffness of a single seat off-road racecar.

            The setup uses a long piece aluminum extrusion which connects to the 
            front hubs on either side of the car. The rear of the car is held fixed and 
            all 4 shocks are replaced with solid steel bars. We use 
            dial indicators to measure deflection and barbell plates to 
            apply load on either side of the car. We collected data for loading 
            and unloading both sides of the car. Using basic trigonometry, 
            we were able to calculate values of stiffness in lb-ft/degree and take an 
            average over the loading and unloading of both sides.

            Our torsional stiffness testing was used to validate simulation results 
            and inform design for future cars.
