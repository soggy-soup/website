          I built a rotary welding table using a recycled motor drive 
          assembly from an old filament winder. The stepper motor, motor driver, 
          chain drive system and chuck were all salvaged from the dumpster.

           The system uses an Arduino paired with a potentiometer to 
           control speed and two switches to control
           ON/OFF and direction.

          The table makes it super easy to maintain consistent weld 
          beads on circular weld joints, especially when performing 
          repetitive welding operations.
