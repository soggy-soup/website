        <p class="projecttext">
            After building the semi-autonomous welding robot, my friend Jaffer and I decided 
            to use the platform for a haptic's class project. We built a teleoperation system for the machine 
            that provides haptic feedback to guide the user along a virtual fixture. A virtual fixture provides the user 
            with haptic feedback to constrain the robot within a certain area. For robotic surgeries, virtual fixtures can help an operator 
            stay within certain boundaries that are safe for the patient.
