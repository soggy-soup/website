        </h1>

        <p class="projecttext">Robotic welding has been around since the early 1980s when auto manufacturers first introduced spot welding robots to the assembly line. Since then lots of progress has been made and current companies such as Path Robotics are working to fully automate welding processes without operator interaction. Current robotic welding cells are expensive to implement and operate on proprietary systems. The objective of my project is to create an open source semi-autonomous 3-axis CNC welding machine that uses a computer vision system to identify and weld weld joints. The machine is meant to be used by smaller size shops to automate tasks utilizing an off the shelf MIG welder. The CNC machine is built from off the shelf parts, uses an open source G-code firmware called GRBL, and uses OpenCV with a monocular camera. Due to the constraints of a 3-axis cartesian CNC machine, the scope of the machine is limited to 2.5-D welding. The computer vision system will identify and weld joints of different lengths, shapes and sizes in 2.5-D space.
