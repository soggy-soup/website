            I bought a 1999 Tomos Targa LX moped which I use for commuting. 
            I rebuilt the engine 2 years ago and have been riding it since. 
            Besides general maintenance, I fabricated a custom intake to mate 
            with an aftermarket carb, made a custom kickstand system, and 
            rebuilt the 2-speed centrifugal clutch.
