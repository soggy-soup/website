            I bought a 1999 Tomos Targa LX moped which I use for commuting. 
            I rebuilt the engine 2 years ago and have been riding it since. 
            Besides general maintenance, I fabricated a custom intake to mate 
            with an aftermarket carb, made a custom kickstand system, and 
            rebuilt the 2-speed centrifugal clutch.

            During my cross country trip on my moped I had a lot of random fixes/maintenance 
            to keep the moped running for 3500 miles. I had 3 flat tires, all of which I had to fix 
            as quickly as possible to continue driving. One flat tire resulted in a crash on the road, 
            performing first aid on myself in a parking lot, fixing the flat, and then driving another 6 hours. 
            I rebuilt parts of the transmission while stopped on Long Island. 
            I rebuilt the engine in less than 3 hours in a parking lot in Raleigh and then drove 8+ hours to my next destination.
