        Inspired by a friend of mine who was rebuilding the engine 
        on an old car of his, I decided to buy a 1990 Mazda Miata 
        to tinker with during my senior year of high school.

        After owning the car for a couple of months, it began to run poorly. 
        I performed a variety of compression tests and found that the cylinders all had 
        low compression from worn piston rings. I decided to 
        tear apart the entire engine and rebuild it despite knowing nothing 
        about engines.

        Over the course of 3 months, I rebuilt the entire engine with just a few 
        simple tools (socket set, screw drivers, pliers, torque wrench), a cheap engine stand 
        and a borrowed engine lift. I used online forums, miata specific books and youtube to 
        help rebuild the engine properly. To fund the replacement parts completely, I picked up free 
        car parts from craigslist and resold them online for profit.

        After rebuilding the engine, I tested its reliability by racing it at 
        a local autocross event. I was able to sell the car under a year after purchasing it 
        making 4x profits from the initial purchase price.
