            I designed the 2023 CWRU Motorsports frame which was part of our car that won first place 
            overall at the 2023 Baja SAE Ohio event. Our 2023 frame is very focused on system 
            integration. The suspension in the rear mounts to sleeved holes drilled in the frame 
            and our 4WD chain routes through 3 sleeved tubes on the bottom plane of the car. Our 
            frame is optimized for weight reduction, driver safety and comfort, torsional stiffness while also 
            adhering to 70+ pages of roll cage rules from SAE.
