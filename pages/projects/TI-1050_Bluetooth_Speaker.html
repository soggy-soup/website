            I took an old TI-1050 calculator, a pair of headphones with 
            a broken headband and combined them. Kind of useless, but could be 
            used as a listening device with the microphone or to inconspicuously 
            play sounds to bother siblings.

            The headphone user interface is accessible through the battery cover. 
            The charging and AUX cable ports are accessible from either side of the 
            calculator.
