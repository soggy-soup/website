        <p class="projecttext">
          Designed a pneumatically powered soft finger for a soft robotics course project.
          The finger is made out of an Ecoflex 30A Silicone elastomer that was molded 
          in a two part molding process.

          The first mold creates the internal air cavities of the finger 
          with an overmolded piece to connect to the air supply. The second
          mold is a rectangular tray (not pictured) that is filled with silicone 
          and a thin fabric to create the bottom of the finger. Once both molds have 
          cured, the two pieces are glued together with silicone.

        <p class="projecttext">
          When the finger is pressurized with air, the thinner ribs expand causing a curling motion 
          of the finger. The bottom of the finger which is thicker and has the fabric inlay is stiff enough 
          to not expand.
